# A summary of the book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto

These LaTeX and PDF documents summarize each section of the book and include all the formulas and algorithms. The content of the original book has not been modified, only summarized. If you find that some parts are not representative of the original book, please let me know at [pierre.enel@gmail.com](mailto:pierre.enel@gmail.com).

Useful as a refresher, it does not replace the book, and doesn't include examples. This is work in progress, for now it covers almost all of the "Tabular Solution Methods", see table of contents.
